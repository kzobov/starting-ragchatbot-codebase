## Technical Implementation

### CSS Variable Strategy
Uses CSS custom properties for color management, allowing instant theme switching by changing the `data-theme` attribute on the root element.

### Icon Animation
Sun and moon icons use CSS transforms for smooth rotation and scaling effects:
- Dark theme: Shows sun icon (ready to switch to light)
- Light theme: Shows moon icon (ready to switch to dark)

### Persistence
Theme preference is stored in `localStorage` and automatically applied on page load, maintaining user preference across sessions.

## Browser Compatibility

- Fallback handled through default dark theme
- SVG icons supported in all modern browsers
- LocalStorage widely supported

## Performance Impact
- Minimal: Only adds ~50 lines of CSS and ~20 lines of JavaScript
- No external dependencies
- Leverages hardware acceleration for smooth transitions
- LocalStorage operations are lightweight
